# Hi! I'm Sultan Nur Korkusuz Gucuk
* 🔭 My profession is Meteorological Engineering, and currently working as an Aviation Weather Forecaster. 
* 📝 Doing my Master's Degree in Earth System Science at Istanbul Technical University. I'm passionate about Data Science & Machine Learning application on Climate Data, and Physical Oceanography.
* 💻 Even though using R on some of my term projects during my Master's Degree, I prefer using Python as a tool on my personal studies.
* 🌱 My short term goal is being a part of applications of Machine Learning/Deep Learning on Physical, and Polar Oceanography Projects in my PhD. My long term goal is being a member of a scientific crew that deal with Climate and Oceanography problems by using Data Science & Artifical Intelligience everyday.
* ⚡ In my spare time, I would enjoy spending my time with books and making podcast about them, diving into video gaming world, and playing with my two adorable cats.



# Background
I completed my Bacholar's Degree in Meteorological Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. My undergraduate thesis was about creating weather charts by using WRF(Weather Research & Forecasting Model) & NCL(NCAR Command Language), and predicting weather with the outputs I obtained. In time, my interests evolved from weather forecast modeling to data science and artificial intelligence. During my Master's Degree I strenghtened my interests with load of knowledge and still (in my thesis term) I'm focusing on them to improve my knowlegde by attending online courses, and making tiny projects by myself. In additon to that, in progress of time, I specified my study area to Oceanography. Because of that my Master's Degree thesis is about Data Science application on Oceanography, and Ocean Modelling.
